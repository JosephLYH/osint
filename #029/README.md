Task briefing:
I took the photo below whilst riding a train in the UK. I always prefer quiet areas where no one can sit behind me because, in a public space, no information is truly private.

Your task is to:

a) Uncover what the person in front of me was reading.
b) Identify the train model.
c) Identify my seat number.
